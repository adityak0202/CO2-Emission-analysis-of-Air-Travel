# CO2-Emission-analysis-of-Air-Travel
Find code that uses data analytics tools to generate insights on how much CO2 is emitted from air-travel, for only a small percentage of the flights operating worldwide.
<br>
Apart from CO2 emission, there are insights on various other metrics like distance travelled, delays in flights, market-leaders by flight-volume and more..
I have even plotted a map, which visualizes the flights as lines on a global map. This provides valuable insight on air-travel zones, where flights are concentrated at airports, and also most-common flight routes used globally, for inter-continental flights. However, I have sampled only about 2000 flights, which is easy on the GPU for rendering. Feel free to adjust this number according to your PC.
A fun little project to practice from.

Tools used: Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Excel.
